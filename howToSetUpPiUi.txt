How to set up pi 4 server with piui:

1) 
Make the pi 4 a server using the instructions here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point-routed.md
Skip the section on "Enable routing and IP masquerading"

2)
Follow the instructions here under the "The do-it-yourself way": https://blog.singleton.io/posts/2013-03-20-introducing-piui/
Instead of 192.168.1.1, use 192.168.4.1, since that is the IP address created in step 1.
Do not yet run the app, as the python 2 code needs to be changed to python 3 to be compatible with modern day libraries.

3)
Run the following commands:
"sudo pip3 install CherryPy"
"sudo pip3 install urllib3"

4)
Make the following changes to the programs to change them from python 2 to python 3:
-change the import statement in test_piui.py from urllib2 to urllib3
-add brackets around the print statements in the __initi__.py and piui_demo.py programs

5)
Run the app from the piui folder using "python3 piui_demo.py"
On the browser type "http://piui:9999" or "http://192.168.4.1:9999"
